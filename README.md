Welcome to **AINepal** – an open-source initiative focused on democratizing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Nepal. Our mission is to make AI accessible, educational, and impactful for Nepali communities through code, content, and collaboration.

## 🌐 About the Project

AINepal is a hybrid platform that combines:

- **Open-source AI tools** for Nepali language and local use cases.
- **Educational content** on AI, ML, Python, and more – in Nepali language.
- A growing **community of learners, developers, and creators** from Nepal.

This repository will include:
- Code from tutorial videos (YouTube: [AINepal Channel](https://youtube.com/@ainepal))
- Nepali language AI tools and datasets
- Useful scripts, notebooks, and demo projects
